# pump-controller

This repository contains the code and setup notes for a Raspberry Pi controlled pump controller.  A temeratute sensor is monitored and a relay-controlled pump is activated when the temperature drops below a set level.  The set temperature is a user-selectable level that may follow a time-of-day achedule.  A physical button on the controller enclosure sends an override to immediately start the oump regardless of measured temperature.
